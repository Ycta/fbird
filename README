Run it as a COM file or write it in the bootsector of a floppy disk.

Press any key to start, press any key to fly!

This game is written using pure 8088 instructions, so it should work
over an original IBM PC with CGA card. No Hercules support (though it
would be a matter of changing the video segment to B000)

If you want to assemble it, you must download the Netwide Assembler
(nasm) from www.nasm.us

Use this command line:

  nasm -f bin fbird.asm -o fbird.com

Only tested with VirtualBox for Mac OS X running Windows XP running this
game, it should be runnable also with DosBox or qemu:

  qemu-system-x86_64 -fda fbird.com

Enjoy it!
